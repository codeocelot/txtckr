txtckr, ("text seeker"), is intended to be an object-oriented approach to implementing an OpenURL resolver, (link resolver). Hopefully txtckr will implement improvements that were identified as <a href='http://161.65.10.251/textseeka/'>textseeka</a> grew, as well as learn from:
  * similar tools such as <a href='http://code.google.com/p/bioguid/'>bioGuid</a>, and <a href='http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Umlaut'>Umlaut</a>
  * other projects which interact with metadata found on web sites and databases such as <a href='http://www.zotero.org'>Zotero</a>.

txtckr is now being implemented using the <a href='http://www.vork.us'>Vork</a> php framework, and I'm working on the MVC stuff, and how I will transform what used to be a procedural codebase.

I'm still aiming to make this work on Windows, but I'm developing on Linux, so no guarantees on how easy it will be... :)
