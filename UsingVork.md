# Details #

MVC design:
  * Model: MongoDB objects
  * View: HTML + jQuery, XML, (RDF/XML?)
  * Controllers: txtckrs code

Other aspects:
  * Helpers for common code across different views, etc. Will use txtckr code for common functions here (date/time conversions, ISBN/ISSN functions, etc.)
  * Built-in support for MongoDB and other databases
