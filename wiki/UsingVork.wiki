Vork details at their website http://www.vork.us - doesn't seem to be much elsewhere!


= Details =

MVC design:
* Model: MongoDB objects
* View: HTML + jQuery, XML, (RDF/XML?)
* Controllers: txtckrs code

Helpers for common code across different views, etc. Will use txtckr code for common functions here (date/time conversions, ISBN/ISSN functions, etc.)
Built-in support for MongoDB and other databases
